                  <p> Rumor me app was a cross platform app where you joined 3-6 of your friends and made up a sentence. Then you would have to draw a picture based on a sentence.

                  <p> A complete real time reddit/hackernews/tech crunch site. By the end of the 54 hours there was a fully functional website. Performed the role of lead developer, presenter and marketing. </p>
                  <p> Under my direction we were the only startup group that was able to validate our revenue model by achieving sales (4 customers to include Hidrate) and received several other startup interests for yearly contracts. </p>
                  <p> Presentation feedback included quotes like "You should win, amazing presentation", "Most presenters would be locked up when there are technical errors for a presentation but you were Steve Jobs like when you kept moving", "I can't believe that was only the second time you've ever presented, I think I would have frozen up when the video didn't play"</p>
