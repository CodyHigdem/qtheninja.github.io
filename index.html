					 <h1> Saga Swell <small> 2012</small></h1>
					 <h2> Buffer meets Wordpress </h2>
					 <p> This website started out as my first major project. I started by integrating wordpress posts with Twitter and Facebook. I integrated social media API's with wordpress to time posts and the out reach at the same time.
					 </p>
					 <p> This was primarilly done in PHP and JS.
					 </p>
				</div>
		 </div>
		 <div class="slide">
				<div class="col-md-6 centred">
					 <h1> Klipr <small>2013</small> </h1>
					 <h2> Startup Weekend Fargo Hackathon: Retail me not meets Instagram </h2>
					 <p> Created a mobile app and a web app oriented towards capturing paper coupons and allowing the user to use the digital version</p>
					 <p> Used javascript, html, php (as a backend) and an android app prototyping program</p>
				</div>
		 </div>
		 <div class="slide">
				<div class="col-md-6 centred">
					 <h1> Chore Boss <small> 2014 </small> </h1>
					 <h2> Startup Weekend Twin Cities Hackathon: Task Rabbit for the Prairie </h2>
					 <p> This was an idea executed in 54 hours. Using PHP and Foundation. We were able to actually validate the idea and make 2 sales (making us the only profitable 'startup' idea for the weekend). </p>
					 <p> Was the developer AND designer after a team member went missing Saturday after promising to pull an all nighter</p>
				</div>

		 <div class="slide">
				<div class="col-md-6 centred">
					 <h1> SketchPerk <small> 2014 </small></h1>
					 <h2> Groupon meets Doodle Me </h2>
					 <p> A cross platform app that required users to sketch out a single sentence. If they acheived the minimum requirements for the coupon they would receive it on their app. </p>
					 <p> Prototype was initially made in Cordova and then ported over to Ionic</p>
				</div>
		 </div>

				<div class="col-md-6 centred">
					 <h1> Rumor Me App <small> 2014 </small> </h1>
					 <h2> The game of Telephone but with pictures...then words...then pictures</h2>
					 <p> Rumor me app was a cross platform app where you joined 3-6 of your friends and made up a sentence. Then you would have to draw a picture based on a sentence. Then you'd have to type out a sentence in response to an image sent to you. Alternating until everyone has gone through. </p>
					 <p> This app was originally prototyped in Apache Cordova and then ported over to jQuery Mobile and Phonegap. Using Laravel/PHP as an API/backend. The hardest challenge was identifying game states with multiple players.</p>

				<div class="col-md-6 centred">
					 <h1> Buy With Time <small> 2014 </small> </h1>
					 <h2> Startup Weekend Fargo: Dollars become Time </h2>

					 <h1> Restarted.co <small> 2015 </small></h1>
					 <h2> Startup Weekend Twin Cities: Lessons Learned for Startups </h2>
					 <p> Restarted is the exact opposite of product hunt. It is instead the bones of startups. Every successful entrepreneur has battle scars that have made them who they are.</p>
					 <p> A complete real time reddit/hackernews/tech crunch site. By the end of the 54 hours there was a fully functional website. Performed the role of lead developer, presenter and marketing. </p>
					 <p> Under my direction we were the only startup group that was able to validate our revenue model by achieving sales (4 customers to include Hidrate) and received several other startup interests for yearly contracts. </p>
					 <p> Presentation feedback included quotes like "You should win, amazing presentation", "Most presenters would be locked up when there are technical errors for a presentation but you were Steve Jobs like when you kept moving", "I can't believe that was only the second time you've ever presented, I think I would have frozen up when the video didn't play"</p>
